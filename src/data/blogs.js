        How We Launch AI-Powered Products in 90 Days
      </h1>
      <p class="description">
        At <a href="/"><strong>Prawise AI</strong></a>, we believe the key to building intelligent products fast is alignment—between teams, data, success metrics, and end users. This playbook captures the steps we use to move from idea to launch in just three months.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-[4rem]">
        1. Frame the problem with ruthless clarity
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        We begin with a Discovery Sprint that unites stakeholders around desired outcomes, guardrails, and the data foundation. We map user journeys, identify moments for intelligence, and define what success looks like numerically and empathetically.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">
        2. Build a right-sized squad
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Every 90-day engagement brings together a strategist, product designer, full-stack engineers, data/ML engineers, and a delivery lead. The squad is autonomous, co-located virtually, and empowered to ship without bureaucratic friction.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">
        3. Prototype the experience, then layer intelligence
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        We prototype flows in Figma and iterate with users before writing production code. When the experience clicks, we plug in intelligence—LLM prompts, classification models, or recommendations—always paired with guardrails and human override.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="p-6 my-8 bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary text-lg">
        “AI that feels magical but stays controllable—that’s the ultimate goal.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">
        4. Automate quality and governance
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        MLOps, CI/CD, automated testing, bias detection, and observability dashboards ensure what we launch is reliable, ethical, and ready to scale. We bake in analytics from day one so teams can monitor adoption and impact.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">
        5. Launch with humans in the loop
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        We deliver training, playbooks, and ongoing optimization support. The 90-day milestone is just the start—continuous improvement cycles keep the product learning and evolving alongside your business.
